            <h2>
                Introduction to my favourite <mark>throws</mark>
            </h2>
            <p>
                To be able to <mark>throw</mark> a person You will need to be able to <em>
                    break
                    that persons balance
                </em>. You simple do not ust grab a person and peform a
                <mark>throw</mark>. Usually a person in balance is very hard to move or <mark>throw</mark>.
                So to be able to perform a good effortless and
                flowing <mark>throw</mark>, then You will need to consider these basic points:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Pull and Drag</li>
                        <li>Hit and Push</li>
                        <li>Using opponents force</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Get into close range by:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stepping in</li>
                        <li>Tightning contact</li>
                        <li>Using opponents force</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Get into corrrect position by:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Moving into opponents weak spot</li>
                        <li>Good and fast footwork</li>
                        <li>Well balanced and good posture</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2> Uchi Mata</h2>

            <p>
                This <mark>throw</mark> is one of the highest-scoring <mark>throws</mark> in
                competition Judo, but be warned: it requires a lot of work to get good at.
                Then again, Uchi Mata works well against bent-over postures that are so common
                in BJJ so that work might just be worth it…
            </p>
            <img src="images/UchiMata.JPG" alt="UchiMata" />
            <p>
                With <strong>Uchi Mata</strong> you partially turn your back towards your opponent
                while pulling very hard to off balance him, and then use one of your legs to lift
                your opponent off the ground and/or kick his leg out. Either way he tumbles to the
                ground.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many variations of Uchi Mata, including hopping versions, non-standard
                grip versions, and attacking the near leg, far leg, or straight up the middle.

            <h2>Yoko Sumi Gaeshi</h2>

            <p>
                Of the techniques listed here <strong>Yoko Sumi Gaeshi</strong> is probably
                seen the least often in competition. But it is undoubtedly effective,
                and it’s also one of my very favourite <mark>throws</mark>.
            </p>
            <img src="images/SumiGaeshi.JPG" alt="SumiGaeshi" />
            <p>
                The initial gripping for this sacrifice <mark>throw</mark> is critical:
                one of your arms controls his arm, and your other arm goes behind his body.
                This grip has similarities to a 2-on-1 (or Russian) grip in Wrestling,
                except you’re coming over his back with one of your arms rather than having
                both your grips controlling his one arm. This allows you to drop your weight
                on his shoulder, breaking his posture and limiting his mobility.
            </p>
            <p>
                If this <mark>throw</mark> is successful (and you follow up correctly) then
                it’s very hard for your opponent put you into the guard. You typically end up
                in a very strong side control position, ready to continue your attack and tap
                him out!

            <h2>Tomoe Nage</h2>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <p>
                <strong>Tomoe Nage</strong> is a Judo sacrifice <mark>throw</mark>.
                Sacrifice <mark>throws</mark> are called that because you temporarily put
                yourself under your opponent before <mark>throwing</mark> him. This may sound
                like a dumb idea, but the sacrifice actually allows you to generate a lot of
                momentum and get very deep under his centre of gravity.
            </p>
            <img src="images/TomoeNage.JPG" alt="TomoeNage" />
            <p>
                Certain Judo <mark>throws</mark> – and Tomoe Nage is one of them – are very well
                suited for BJJ practitioners, because if you screw them up (i.e. if your opponent
                doesn’t get thrown) then you usually end up in the guard rather than being
                completely and utterly out of position.
            </p>
            <p>
                This <mark>throw</mark> comes in two broad categories: traditional or straight-on
                Tomoe Nage, and sideways Tomoe Nage (also known as ‘Yoko Tomoe Nage’).

            <h2>Magnus first thoughts</h2>

            <a href="http://www.lexingtoncompany.com/sv/homeinterior/bathroom/robes"><img src="images/Badrock.JPG" alt="White Bath-Robe" title="Bath Robe" /></a>
            <p>
                First thing that pop-up in Magnus head is a whit bath robe.
                I countered with Bananas in Pyjamas but he thought that was a bit far fetched.
            </p>

            <h2>Next thought that popped-up</h2>
            <p>
                Fortunately Magnus had some knowledge of the nobel art of JiuJitsu.
                So he recalled the Samurai, the great warrior of ancient Japan.
