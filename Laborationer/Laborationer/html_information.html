    <h2>html structual elements</h2>
    <p>
        We start of with the "!DOCTYPE HTML" that says this is a html5 document.
        The "html"at the top and bottom encloses the html document.
        Next we have the "head" wich contains the metadata.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Body" shows up next and this i the canvas we use to design our homepage.
        This is what is visual in the browser.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the body we have the "header" which is visual at the top of the browser.
        Here we add features as "nav" which is shoort for navigation. This is used to in this case to
        navigate around between the pages.
    </p>
    <p>
        After header we go into what the webpage is about ... text and pictures, audio and video.
        Usually You should look at this part as an article in an newspaper with all it features as sections
        , headings and paragraphs. And alas this is also the case with html were we have "section"
        "article", "paragraph". If You ae not familiar with this or how a newspaper is built then please
        contact Freddie Wahlgren for a great explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the bottom we have the "footer" which usually contains name and adress of the owner of the html document.
